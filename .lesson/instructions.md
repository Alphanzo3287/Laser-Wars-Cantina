This assignment reinforces the use of cin, variables, constants and arithmetic expressions.

Use a cinÂ statement to ask the user to input the amount for the meal.

(HINT: Every time you run the program, the user could input a different amount. The example shown below is just one example you can use for validation where the user inputs the amount of 12.00).

Also, use a constant for both the Tip Amount and the Tax Amount. Use good naming conventions and good C++ style which dictate that constants are always uppercase.

(HINT: use the reserved word const and a data type when you declare a constant. Refer to Chapter 2 for examples of how to declare and use constants.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will calculate the total due for a restaurant bill. The program asks the user to input from the keyboard the meal charge. (Only input numbers and the decimal place. Do not input the dollar sign.)

The program will then compute the tip amount and the tax amount and display the total. It should be noted that the tip is calculated pre-tax and the tax should be calculated based on the meal charge only. This prevents the tip amount from being inflated due to the tax amount.

You don't have to format the output using <iomanip>, we learn that next week, but you're welcome to do so if you would like. In fact, you can earn a couple of extra points if you use iomanip correctly to show 2 decimal places for the dollars and cents and align the decimal places in the table.


Submit the assignment to let me know are finished.




The program should follow this example:
